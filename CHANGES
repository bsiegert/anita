On unknown platforms, use mkisofs instead of genisoimage.

On sparc, the scratch disk is sd1c, not wd1d.

Allow a full hour for extracting sets.

Invoke the i386 version of qemu as "qemu-system-i386" rather
than just "qemu", because a current stock git qemu doesn't
install a binary called just "qemu".

Specify "cache=writeback" for the emulated hard disk; this
significantly speeds up installation at least in some versions
of qemu.

After running the ATF tests, run "ps" to show any processes possibly
left running by the tests.

- 1.23 released -

Support qemu 0.15, where the output of the "info block" monitor
command has backwards-incompatibly changed to no longer include a
"type" field.

- 1.22 released -

New command line option "--memory-size".

- 1.21 released -

Disk images no longer contain holes, making them easier to use with
vnd(4).  Partially based on patch from Vladimir Kirillov.

Increase the default disk size from 512M to 768M, as 512M is no longer
sufficient for amd64.

- 1.20 released -

Run df before and after the ATF tests so that disk usage data
can be gathered from the test logs.

Increase the default timeout for the ATF test from 1 hour to 2 hours
as the number of tests has now increased to a point where 1 hour is
not always enough even on a fast machine.

Increase the timeout for the set extraction phase from 1200 to 2400
seconds; the extra time is needed when installing a system built
without optimization.

- 1.19 released -

Rename the --qemu-args option to --vmm-args in preparation for adding
support for other virtual machine monitors in addition to qemu.

Fix typos found by Antti Kantee and Jean-Yves Migeon.

Deprecate the --qemu-args -no-kvm-irqchip workaround, as it doesn't
quite work.

Add support for MacOS X hosts, from Jeff Rizzo.

New command line option "--test-timeout".

Deal with yet another seemingly nondeterministic "Press enter to
continue" prompt.

- 1.18 released -

Deal with sysinst no longer asking for a password cipher.

Create the work directory in "test" mode so that it works without
running "install" first.

Fix incorrect description of the --workdir option in the man page, and
consistently use the term "work directory" throughout.

Reorganized the man page, adding a MODES section.

New mode "print-workdir".

Fix installation of historical versions of -current around
CVS date 2009.08.23.20.57.40.

- 1.17 released -

Fix bugs in the new features introduced in 1.16: the --sets option
only worked when passing the URL of a distribution directory (rather
than a pathname or the url of an ISO), and exporting of ATF output
only worked when using --workdir with an abolute pathname.

- 1.16 released -

Update the discussion of Linux KVM virtualization compatibility in the
BUGS section, noting the --qemu-args -no-kvm-irqchip workaround and
including a reference to PR 44069.

New command line option "--sets".

Add a rudimentary INSTALL file.

The "misc" set is now installed by default, as it is required for
the ATF XML DTD, XSL files, and style sheets.

The "test" command now exports the raw and XML format ATF output
to the host, along with some auxiliary files needed for further
processing of the XML output.

Add support for FreeBSD hosts, from Kurt Lidl.

- 1.15 released -

Increase the timeout for "--run" commands to one hour.

Restrict snapshotting to the system disk, so that additional disks
mounted for the purpose of exporting data can be persistently
modified.

- 1.14 released -

Increase the maximum number of boot floppies, as four is no longer
enough for amd64.

New command line option "--run".

Handle the additional dialogs displayed by sysinst when an
i386 or amd64 system has more than one disk.

Add the words "OR CONTRIBUTORS" to the disclaimer of liabilities
in the copyright notice.

- 1.13 released -

When installing NetBSD/sparc, use a terminal type of "xterm" rather
than "sun", as anita is more likely run from an xterm or other
ANSI-like terminal than from a sun console.

In the BUGS section of the man page, mention the specific NetBSD ports
affected.

Fix typos in the man page.

- 1.12 released -

Add support for the amd64 and sparc ports as targets.

Improve error reporting for common types of unsuitable URLs.

Avoid sending multiple responses when the NetBSD 3.0.1 sysinst
updates the menu display multiple times.

New command line option "--disk-size".

- 1.11 released -

Remove '-serial stdio' from qemu argument list.  It's not actually
needed when the '-nographic' option is present, and it confuses
qemu 0.12.

- 1.10 released -

Deal with recent sysinst changes: sysinst no longer displays a dialog
to select the CD-ROM device path, etc.

New command line option "--qemu-args".

Anita no longer passes the "-no-acpi" option to qemu by default,
because the ACPI case now works with -current, and disabling
ACPI triggers other bugs.  See PR port-i386/42681 for more details.

- 1.9 released -

Deal with recent renumbering of password encryption choices in sysinst.

- 1.8 released -

Increase timeouts, particularly when extracting sets and running the
ATF tests

Document the "test" command and path-in-place-of-URL

- 1.7 released -

Remove workaround for lib/39175, which broke the installation
of the "comp" set

Add "test" command for running the ATF tests

Accept a local distribution directory path in place of a URL

Check for missing slash at end of distribution directory URL

Detect HTTP 404 errors

- 1.6 released -

This is the documentation for Anita, an Automated NetBSD Installation
and Test Application.

Anita is an experimental tool for automated testing of the NetBSD/i386
installation procedure.  Using anita, you can download a NetBSD/i386
distribution and install it in a qemu virtual machine in a fully
automated fashion.  It's fun to watch, and it has already played a
part in finding several bugs in NetBSD.

Anita is written in Python and uses the pexpect module to "screen
scrape" the sysinst output over an emulated serial console and
script the installation procedure.

Anita is still a work in progress.  Currently, only NetBSD/i386 is
supported as the system to install, but it should be possible to add
support for installing other ports of NetBSD, as well as
cross-installation setups where the machine running anita is a
different architecture from the virtual machine being installed on.

If you want to play with it, here is what you need:

 - The latest anita tarball from
   <http://www.gson.org/netbsd/anita/download/>

 - NetBSD-current from August 7, 2006 or newer (otherwise you will run
   into a kernel bug which causes some of the serial console output to
   be dropped on its way from qemu to pexpect; see kern/34129).  Note
   that this requirement concerns the host system (the one you run
   anita on), not the target system (the one being installed in the
   virtual machine)

 - pkgsrc/emulators/qemu

 - pkgsrc/devel/py-pexpect

 - sysutils/cdrtools

 - A network connection for downloading installation file sets

 - About a gigabyte of free disk space

Unpack the anita tarball and cd into the resulting directory.  You
should now be able to download and install a NetBSD release in a
virtual machine using a one-line shell command.  For example, to
install NetBSD 4.0 from the master NetBSD FTP site, enter

   ./anita install http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-4.0/i386/

Or a snapshot; the URL in this example will most likely have expired
by the time you read this, but if you replace the date with a current
one, it should work:

   ./anita install http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD-daily/netbsd-4/200802140000Z/i386/

Or to install from an ISO image:

   ./anita install i386cd-4.0.iso

If you have built NetBSD locally using "build.sh -R", you can point
Anita directly at the RELEASEDIR:

  ./anita install file:///path/to/releasedir/

Anita will cache the distribution sets, boot floppies, and a hard disk
image in a directory "netbsd-<hash>" under the current working
directory, effectively turning the install() method a no-op if it is
invoked again without first removing the cached files.  If you remove
just the hard disk image (wd0.img), install() will recreate it from
the cached distribution files.

To boot the newly installed hard disk image and get a login prompt,
type "interact" instead of "install", for example:

   ./anita interact i386cd-4.0.iso

To kill the virtual machine and return to Python, type control-a x.

Anita runs qemu with the "-snapshot" flag, so if you log in and make
changes to the system, they will not be saved to the disk image file
by default.

Anita has been tested with the NetBSD 2.1, 3.0.1, 3.1, and 4.0
releases and a number of recent daily binary snapshots and local
builds.  Releases prior to 4.0 will install correctly, but but for
some unknown reason, booting the resulting hard disk image doesn't
work (it hangs after the "root on ffs" message).  Perhaps someone can
figure out why this happens, or even fix it.  Booting NetBSD 4.0 or
-current works fine.

Please send any comments, bug reports, or patches to gson@gson.org.

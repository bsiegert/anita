This is the documentation for Anita, an Automated NetBSD Installation
and Test Application.

Anita is an experimental tool for automated testing of the NetBSD/i386
installation procedure.  Using anita, you can download a NetBSD/i386
distribution and install it in a qemu virtual machine in a fully
automated fashion.  It's fun to watch, and it has already played a
part in finding several bugs in NetBSD.

Anita is written in Python and uses the pexpect module to "screen
scrape" the sysinst output (over an emulated serial console) and
script the installation procedure.

Anita is still a work in progress.  Currently, only NetBSD/i386 is
supported as the system to install, but it should be possible to add
support for installing other ports, as well as cross-installation
setups where the machine running anita is a different architecture
from the virtual machine being installed on.

If you want to play with it, here is what you need:

 - The latest anita tarball from <http://www.gson.org/netbsd/anita/>

 - NetBSD-current from August 7, 2006 or newer (otherwise you will run
   into a kernel bug which causes some of the serial console output to
   be dropped on its way from qemu to pexpect; see kern/34129).  Note
   that this requirement concerns the host system (the one you run
   anita on), not the target system (the one being installed in the
   virtual machine)

 - pkgsrc/emulators/qemu.  Unfortunately, qemu doesn't build
   out of the box on -current, creating a bit of a catch-22
   with respect to the previous requirement.  Someone please
   fix this.

 - pkgsrc/devel/py-pexpect

 - A network connection for downloading installation file sets

 - About a gigabyte of free disk space

You should now be able to download and install a NetBSD release in a
virtual machine like this:

   $ python
   >>> import anita
   >>> ver = anita.Release("3.1")
   >>> ver.install()

If you have built NetBSD locally using build.sh -R, you can install it
by calling anita.LocalBuild with a string identifying the NetBSD
version (using any naming scheme you like) and the RELEASEDIR, as in:

   >>> ver = anita.LocalBuild("my-current", "/path/to/releasedir")
   >>> ver.install()

If you can find a daily build for i386 on releng.netbsd.org
(unfortuately, they are not always availble), you can install it by
calling anita.DailyBuild with the name of the branch (e.g., "3" or
"HEAD") and the timestamp identifying the daily build, as in:

   >>> ver = anita.DailyBuild("4", "200608280000Z")
   >>> ver.install()

Anita will cache the distribution sets, boot floppies, and a hard disk
image in a directory "netbsd-<version>" under the current working
directory, effectively turning the install() method a no-op if it is
invoked again without first removing the cached files.  If you remove
just the hard disk image (wd0.img), install() will recreate it from
the cached distribution files.

To boot the newly installed hard disk image and get a login prompt,
type

   >>> ver.interact()

To kill the virtual machine and return to Python, type control-a x.

Anita runs qemu with the "-snapshot" flag, so if you log in and make
changes to the system, they will not be saved to the disk image file
by default.

Anita has been tested with the 2.1, 3.0.1, and 3.1 releases and a few
daily builds and local builds.  With the releases, the installation
part works, but for some unknown reason, booting the resulting hard
disk image doesn't work (it hangs after the "root on ffs" message).
Perhaps someone can figure out why this happens, or even fix it.
Booting a NetBSD-current image works fine.

Please send any comments, bug reports, or patches to gson@gson.org.
